**Updated Files:**

**Changes:**

- "Back to Inventory" button returns users to their previous location with filters/sorting preserved
- Similar coaches also maintain navigation state
- Fallback to `/inventory` if no previous state exists

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\tmcha\Dev\prevostgo\backend
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Start Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\tmcha\Dev\prevostgo\frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Navigation Flow:**
   - Go to inventory page
   - Apply some filters and sorting
   - Click on a coach to view details
   - Click "Back to Inventory" - should return to the same filtered/sorted view
   - Test from homepage as well

4. **Test Sorting:**
   - Verify "Contact for Price" coaches appear at the end
   - Test all sort options work correctly
   - Ensure sorting persists when navigating

## Deployment Notes

- No database migrations required
- No new dependencies added
- All changes are backward compatible
- Ensure both frontend and backend are deployed together for sorting to work properly

## Known Improvements for Future
- Add URL persistence for sort order (currently only filters are in URL)
- Add loading state for sort changes
