# PrevostGO Production Fix Guide

## üö® Production Issues & Solutions

### 1. Check Production Status
Run this Python script to check if everything is working:
```bash
cd C:\Users\tmcha\Dev\prevostgo\scripts
python check_production.py
```

### 2. Railway Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in your Railway backend service:

```
DATABASE_URL=<your-railway-postgres-url>
CORS_ORIGINS=https://prevostgo.com,https://www.prevostgo.com,http://prevostgo.com,http://www.prevostgo.com
ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS=false
RUN_INITIAL_SCRAPE=false
```

### 3. If Database is Empty
Run the scraper to populate with real data:
```bash
cd C:\Users\tmcha\Dev\prevostgo\scripts
python trigger_production_scraper.py
```

### 4. Common Issues & Fixes

#### ‚ùå Coaches not showing on frontend
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Look for CORS errors or 404s
3. Verify API URL in production

#### ‚ùå "No coaches found" message
1. Database is empty - run the scraper
2. API is not returning data - check Railway logs

#### ‚ùå CORS errors
1. Update CORS_ORIGINS in Railway to include your domain
2. Redeploy the backend service

### 5. Railway Deployment Commands
```bash
# Check Railway CLI is installed
railway --version

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to your project
cd C:\Users\tmcha\Dev\prevostgo
railway link

# View logs
