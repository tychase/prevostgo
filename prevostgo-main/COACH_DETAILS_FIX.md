# Coach Details Page Loading Fix

## Issue Identified
The coach details page was failing to load due to a route conflict in the backend. There was a duplicate route definition for `/api/inventory/{coach_id}` in `main.py` that was conflicting with the proper async route in the inventory router.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend (main.py)
- **Removed** the duplicate route definition `@app.get("/api/inventory/{coach_id}")` from main.py
- This route was using synchronous SQLite queries which conflicted with the async SQLAlchemy route in the inventory router

### 2. Frontend Improvements
- **Enhanced error handling** in `CoachDetailPage.jsx`:
  - Added detailed error messages
  - Added console logging for debugging
  - Improved error display with specific messages for 404 errors
  - Added a "Back to Inventory" link in error states

- **Added debugging** to `api.js`:
  - Added console logs to track coach ID and request URLs
  - This helps debug any future issues with API calls

- **Created debug component** (`CoachDebugTest.jsx`):
  - Accessible at `/debug-coach`
  - Shows coach IDs and allows testing the detail endpoint
  - Useful for verifying the API is working correctly

## How to Test

1. **Restart the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Make sure the frontend is running**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the fix**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/inventory
   - Click on any coach card
   - The details page should now load correctly

4. **Debug if needed**:
   - Visit http://localhost:3000/debug-coach to test the API endpoints
   - Check browser console for any error messages
   - Check backend console for API requests

## Verification Steps

1. The inventory list should load and display coaches
2. Clicking a coach card should navigate to `/inventory/{coach_id}`
3. The detail page should show:
   - Coach images
   - Price, year, mileage, and other details
   - Features list
   - Dealer information
   - Contact buttons

## Potential Issues to Watch For

1. **Empty Database**: If no coaches appear, run the scraper:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python scraper_final_v2.py
   ```

2. **CORS Issues**: The backend is configured to allow all origins in development, but check if you see CORS errors

3. **Missing Images**: Some coaches might not have images - the frontend handles this with placeholder images

## Next Steps

1. Test the fix thoroughly with different coaches
2. Add the "Similar Coaches" functionality (currently shows placeholder text)
3. Implement the inquiry form submission
4. Add analytics tracking for coach views

The main issue has been resolved by removing the conflicting route definition. The coach details page should now work correctly!
