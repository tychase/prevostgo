# Coach Details Page 500 Error Fix

## Problem
The coach details page was returning a 500 Internal Server Error due to strict Pydantic validation failing on the backend. The issues were:

1. **Enum validation**: The `condition` field was expecting strict enum values ("new" or "pre-owned") but the database had variations
2. **Email validation**: The `dealer_email` field was expecting valid email format but some entries had invalid emails
3. **Missing defaults**: Some fields like `price_status` and `slide_count` could be null but the schema expected values

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Schema Updates (`app/models/schemas.py`)
- Changed `condition` from `ConditionEnum` to `str` to handle various formats
- Changed `dealer_email` from `EmailStr` to `Optional[str]` to handle invalid emails
- Changed `price_status` from `PriceStatusEnum` to `str` for flexibility
- Made the schema more forgiving of data variations

### 2. Router Updates (`app/routers/inventory.py`)
- Added comprehensive error handling with try/catch blocks
- Added data normalization for condition values:
  - "new" → "new"
  - Anything else → "pre-owned"
- Added email validation check before returning
- Added defaults for nullable fields:
  - `price_status` defaults to "contact_for_price"
  - `slide_count` defaults to 0
- Added detailed error logging for debugging

### 3. Debug Endpoint (`main.py`)
- Added `/api/debug/coach/{coach_id}` endpoint for troubleshooting
- Returns raw data without Pydantic validation
- Useful for checking actual database values

### 4. Frontend Error Handling
- Enhanced error messages in `CoachDetailPage.jsx`
- Added console logging for debugging
- Better user feedback for 404 and 500 errors

## Testing Steps

1. **Restart the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Test the fix**:
   - Visit http://localhost:3000/inventory
   - Click any coach card
   - Details page should load without errors

3. **If issues persist**:
   - Check console for specific error messages
   - Use debug endpoint: http://localhost:3000/api/debug/coach/{coach_id}
   - Check backend console for detailed error logs

## Data Cleanup (Optional)

If you want to clean up the database data:

```python
# Run this script to normalize condition values
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('prevostgo.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Normalize condition values
cursor.execute("""
    UPDATE coaches 
    SET condition = CASE 
        WHEN LOWER(condition) LIKE '%new%' AND LOWER(condition) NOT LIKE '%pre%' THEN 'new'
        ELSE 'pre-owned'
    END
""")

# Clear invalid emails
cursor.execute("""
    UPDATE coaches 
    SET dealer_email = NULL 
    WHERE dealer_email NOT LIKE '%@%'
""")

conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

## Summary

The 500 error has been fixed by making the backend more tolerant of data variations. The schema now handles:
- Different condition formats
- Invalid email addresses
- Missing optional fields
- Data normalization on the fly

The coach details page should now work correctly!
