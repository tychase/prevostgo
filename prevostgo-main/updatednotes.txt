PrevostGO Project Status
What's Working:

Frontend is running on localhost:3000 (React/Vite)
Frontend UI displays correctly but shows no coaches
SQLite database exists with 391 coaches (should be 700+)

Current Issues:

Backend won't start due to Python 3.13 compatibility issues:

Fixed Pydantic (updated to 2.9.2)
Fixed SQLAlchemy (updated to 2.0.35)
Still has issues with lxml/aiohttp build failures on Windows


Database is missing coaches (391 instead of 700+)

Key Files:

Best scraper: backend/scraper_final_v2.py
Database: backend/prevostgo.db
Integrated scraper: backend/app/services/scraper.py (modified to use requests instead of aiohttp)

Next Steps:

Get backend running (may need to install Microsoft C++ Build Tools for lxml)
Run scraper_final_v2.py to populate all 700+ coaches
Backend has a /api/inventory/scrape endpoint to trigger scraping via API

Environment:

Windows with Python 3.13
Virtual environment at C:\Users\tmcha\Dev\prevostgo\venv
Frontend uses npm/Node.js

The project structure is correct, just need to resolve the Python dependencies and populate the full database.

I then had ChatGPT look into it. Reply:

It turned out nothing was actually “wrong” with your HeroSearch component or your HomePage—your layout was never rendering any of your routed pages. In React-Router v6, nested routes don’t get passed into your <Layout> as children; instead you have to render them via an <Outlet/>.

What’s happening now
Your App.jsx defines:
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Layout />}>
    <Route index element={<HomePage />} />
    …
  </Route>
</Routes>

But your Layout.jsx never imports or uses <Outlet/>. You have:
const Layout = ({ children }) => (
  …
  <div className="flex-grow">
    {children}
  </div>
  …
)

React-Router doesn’t hand you a children prop there, so {children} is always empty ⇒ your <HomePage/> (with its HeroSearch/search bar) never shows up.

he fix
Import Outlet from react-router-dom

Replace your {children} placeholder with <Outlet />

(Optionally) drop the { children } parameter since you’re no longer using it.

Here’s a minimal diff you can apply to src/components/Layout.jsx:

-import React, { useState } from 'react';
-import { Link, useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';
+import React, { useState } from 'react';
+import { Link, useLocation, Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';

…

-const Layout = ({ children }) => {
+const Layout = () => {
  return (
    <div className="bg-[#0a0a0a] min-h-screen font-sans text-white relative">
      …
      <div className="relative z-10 flex flex-col min-h-screen">
        <Header />
-       <div className="flex-grow">
-         {children}
-       </div>
+       <div className="flex-grow">
+         <Outlet />
+       </div>
        <Footer />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Layout;

After that, <HomePage /> (and its <HeroSearch/>) will be injected into your layout at the <Outlet/> spot, and your search bar will reappear.
