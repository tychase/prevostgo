# PrevostGO Scraper Implementation Summary

## What We Built

We've created a comprehensive web scraper for PrevostGO that collects luxury coach listings from prevost-stuff.com.

## Key Files Created

1. **`scraper_final.py`** - The main production scraper
   - Fetches listings from prevost-stuff.com
   - Parses coach details (year, model, price, features)
   - Handles both main page and detail page scraping
   - Saves data to SQLite database
   - Includes price parsing and feature extraction

2. **`SCRAPER_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive documentation
   - How to run the scraper
   - Database schema explanation
   - Scheduling and automation tips
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Future enhancement ideas

3. **`test_scraper.py`** - Testing utility
   - Tests price parsing logic
   - Tests feature extraction
   - Verifies scraping functionality
   - Checks database integrity

4. **`add_sample_data.py`** - Sample data generator
   - Adds realistic test coaches if needed
   - Useful for frontend development
   - Includes various price ranges and features

## Key Features

### Smart Price Parsing
- Handles multiple price formats: "$1,399,999", "Price: $499,000", etc.
- Detects "Contact for Price" listings
- Identifies sold coaches
- Stores prices in cents for accurate calculations

### Feature Extraction
- Detects slide counts from titles
- Identifies bunk coaches
- Recognizes wheelchair accessible units
- Extracts converter/manufacturer names

### Two-Stage Scraping
1. **Main Page**: Gets all listings quickly
2. **Detail Pages**: Fetches missing prices (optional)

### Data Integrity
- Generates unique IDs based on coach attributes
- Updates existing records instead of duplicating
- Preserves sold status
- Tracks scrape timestamps
