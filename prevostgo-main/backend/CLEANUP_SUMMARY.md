# Backend Cleanup Summary

## What We Did

1. **Organized 23 test/scraper files** into proper directories:
   - `tests/` - All test files
   - `scripts/checks/` - Database and API check scripts
   - `scripts/fixes/` - Data fix and migration scripts
   - `scripts/setup/` - Setup and initialization scripts
   - `scripts/scrapers/` - Scraper runner scripts
   - `scripts/utilities/` - Image download utilities

2. **Consolidated scrapers**:
   - Kept `app/services/scraper.py` (basic scraper)
   - Kept `app/services/scraper_enhanced.py` (PRIMARY - with improvements)
   - Removed 5 redundant scraper implementations

3. **Improved the enhanced scraper**:
   - Added converter extraction from titles (now 621/723 coaches have converters)
   - Improved price parsing to handle $1.5M format
   - Changed default from 'Unknown' to empty string for missing data

4. **Fixed search filters**:
   - Converter filter now searches in title field (where data actually exists)
   - Model filter searches in both model and title fields
   - Filters now return proper results

## Next Steps

1. Run the enhanced scraper with `fetch_details=True` to get prices from detail pages
2. Update the frontend to show proper "Contact for Price" messaging
3. Consider adding a scheduled job to run the scraper periodically
